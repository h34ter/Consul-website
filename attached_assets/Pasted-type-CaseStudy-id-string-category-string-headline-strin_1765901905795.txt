    checkpoints: {
      hiddenConstraint: 'Agents were losing deals because property matching was manual and slow. A listing would come in, an agent would manually search their database, spend hours on emails, and by then the lead was already working with someone else. The real cost: missed commissions, lost market share, and agents working 60+ hour weeks just to stay competitive.\n\nWhat was actually broken:\n- Property matching took 2–4 hours per new listing (manual database search + filtering).\n- Outreach was templated and impersonal (low response rates, ~8%).\n- Client follow-ups relied on human memory (many leads fell through the cracks).\n- No visibility into which listings matched which client profiles.',
      discovery: 'During the audit, we mapped the entire agent workflow: lead intake → property search → outreach → follow-up → deal close. We discovered that agents were spending 60% of their time on activities that could be automated, and their biggest fear was losing personal touch (we solved that by keeping the agent\'s voice in every message).\n\nKey insight:\nThe bottleneck wasn\'t complexity—it was speed. Agents needed to match clients to properties in minutes, not hours, and send personalized outreach automatically while they focused on closing.',
      blueprint: 'System architecture:\n1) Property Matching Engine: Real-time matching of new listings against stored client preferences.\n2) Personalized Outreach Generator: AI-powered emails customized to each client\'s saved preferences.\n3) Agent Dashboard: One central place to see matched leads, outreach status, and follow-up reminders.\n4) Automated Follow-up System: Reminders for agents to follow up, with templated messages.\n5) CRM Integration: Syncs with existing agent tools (email, calendar, MLS data).\n\nKey decisions:\n- Matching runs in real-time.\n- Messages are agent-customizable to maintain personal brand.\n- Dashboard shows only actionable items.',
      results: 'Before:\n- Average time to match a lead: 2–4 hours.\n- Manual outreach response rate: ~8%.\n- Agents worked 60+ hour weeks.\n- Deal close rate: ~15% of matched leads.\n\nAfter:\n- Average time to match a lead: 2 minutes.\n- Automated outreach response rate: 23%.\n- Agents freed up 20+ hours per week.\n- Deal close rate: 38% of matched leads.\n\nClient quote:\n"This system replaced the most tedious part of my job. I\'m now closing 2–3 deals per week instead of 1, and I\'m actually enjoying the work again." — Real Estate Agent Partner'

      discovery: 'We tracked 20 new client onboardings and found they averaged 15+ touchpoints before understanding what to do.

      discovery: 'We analyzed 200 license issuances and found a 15% error rate. We traced 30+ instances of license sharing.
