Replit Prompt - Final Case Study Implementation (5 Detailed Systems)
"Implement the Case Study section with the 'Clean Grid' design and the detailed 'Checkpoint Modal' interaction for the 5 specified systems.

1. Case Study Grid (Main Page)
Design:

Layout: 2x3 Grid (6 cards total).

Style: Minimalist, text-only, dark theme (var(--color-card)).

Content: Small Category Badge + Bold Hook Question + Flow Diagram (Text) + Metric.

Hover: Card lift + border glow.

The 6 Cards:

Marketplace Operations

Hook: "Manually searching 50+ sites daily?"

Flow: 50+ sources manually → AI matches in 2 min → Perfect inventory in Inbox

Metric: ⚡ 24/7 discovery - 10x more matches

Customer Operations

Hook: "Clients falling through the cracks?"

Flow: Scattered emails & DMs → Slack hub + Bot → Automated pipeline

Metric: ⚡ 89% faster response - 3.2x more closed

Content Operations

Hook: "Can't keep up with posting?"

Flow: 1 video per week → AI repurposing → 100 pieces daily

Metric: ⚡ 10x content output - 92% time saved

Sales Operations

Hook: "Losing bids because you're too slow?"

Flow: Manual RFP writing → AI auto-fill → 15 min response

Metric: ⚡ 15 min per RFP - 10x more bids

Revenue Infrastructure

Hook: "Selling digital products manually?"

Flow: Manual key issuing → Automated DRM → Instant & secure

Metric: ⚡ $2.3M secured - 99.9% uptime

Healthcare Operations

Hook: "Staff drowning in paperwork?"

Flow: Manual intake forms → HIPAA-compliant AI → Fully automated

Metric: ⚡ 76% faster intake - 100% compliance

2. Case Study Modal (Detail View)
Design:

Style: Dark, text-focused, max-width 800px.

Header: Category + Title (Big).

Body: 4 Vertical Checkpoints (01 Hidden Constraint, 02 Discovery, 03 Blueprint, 04 Results).

Footer: 'Request Audit' button.

Content Data (Use EXACT Text Provided):

For the checkpoints object in your data array, use the full text below:

1. Marketplace Operations

Checkpoint 01 (Hidden Constraint): "A high-volume business was losing opportunities because matching records manually was slow and error-prone. New data would come in, someone would manually search existing records, spend hours filtering, and by then the opportunity was gone. The real cost: missed revenue, lost market share, and teams working insane hours just to stay competitive."

Checkpoint 02 (Discovery): "During the audit, we mapped the entire workflow: data intake → manual search → decision → outreach → follow-up → conversion. We discovered that the team was spending 60% of their time on activities that could be automated. Key insight: The bottleneck wasn't complexity—it was speed."

Checkpoint 03 (Blueprint): "System architecture: 1) Intelligent Matching Engine (Real-time matching against criteria). 2) Personalized Outreach Generator (AI-generated contextual messages). 3) Unified Command Dashboard (Real-time visibility). 4) Human-in-the-Loop Approval (AI suggests, humans approve)."

Checkpoint 04 (Results): "Before: 2–4 hours to match a record. 70% accuracy. After: 2 minutes to match. 94% accuracy. 0% records lost. Revenue impact: Recovered €80k+ in year-one revenue."

2. Customer Operations

Checkpoint 01: "Client onboarding was chaos. Resources scattered across 5+ platforms. New clients had no structured path and 40% fell off. Admins spent 3+ hours per week chasing people down."

Checkpoint 02: "We tracked 20 new client onboardings and found they averaged 15+ touchpoints before understanding what to do. Key insight: The problem wasn't content—it was delivery. Clients needed ONE place, ONE checklist, ONE bot."

Checkpoint 03: "System architecture: 1) Private Client Channel (Slack). 2) Automated Onboarding Checklist. 3) Support Bot (Real-time FAQs). 4) Admin Dashboard (Progress visibility)."

Checkpoint 04: "Before: 60% completion rate. 8h support resolution. After: 94% completion rate. 15-min resolution. Admin time: 20 min/week."

3. Content Operations

Checkpoint 01: "The creative team was burning out. Producing one high-quality video took days. Then came the manual grind: resizing, captions, scheduling. By the time they finished distribution, they had no energy for creation."

Checkpoint 02: "We audited the workflow and found 85% of time was spent on format conversion, not creativity. Key insight: You needed a factory model. One raw asset in → infinite adaptations out."

Checkpoint 03: "System architecture: 1) Ingestion & Transcription Engine. 2) Intelligent Repurposing Core (AI clips & captions). 3) Approval Workflow. 4) Unified Scheduler."

Checkpoint 04: "Before: 1 video + 2 posts/week. After: 100+ pieces of content daily. Engagement: Up 400%."

4. Sales Operations

Checkpoint 01: "Every decision required manual routing. Requests got stuck in inboxes. A discount request took 5 days. 15% of requests were lost indefinitely."

Checkpoint 02: "We tracked 100 requests and found average approval time was 8 days. Key insight: The problem wasn't decision-making—it was visibility and routing."

Checkpoint 03: "System architecture: 1) Smart Request Intake. 2) Automatic Routing. 3) Parallel Approvals. 4) Real-Time Queue Visibility. 5) Escalation Logic."

Checkpoint 04: "Before: 5–7 days approval. 12% lost requests. After: 4 hours approval. 0% lost. Revenue impact: €120k+ annual value."

5. Revenue Infrastructure

Checkpoint 01: "Paid software users were sharing licenses, resulting in 20–30% revenue leakage. License keys were issued manually (error-prone), revocation took days, and audits were nightmares."

Checkpoint 02: "We analyzed 200 issuances and found 15% errors. Revocation had a 3–5 day lag. Key insight: You needed real-time issuance, session-level verification, and instant revocation."

Checkpoint 03: "System architecture: 1) Automated License Generation. 2) Real-Time Session Verification. 3) Usage Monitoring & Fraud Detection. 4) Instant Revocation."

Checkpoint 04: "Before: 4–8h issuance. 30% leakage. After: 2-min issuance. <3% leakage. Recovered €80k in annual revenue."

Implementation Instructions
Update caseStudies data array with the full text provided above for the 5 active systems.

Ensure CaseStudyModal renders the 4 checkpoints correctly (vertical stack, timeline line).

Ensure CaseStudyGrid renders the 6 cards with the "Flow Diagram" text visualization (e.g., Step A → Step B → Step C).

Link the Grid to the Modal (Clicking a card opens the corresponding detailed modal).

Goal: Clean, high-conversion grid leading to deep, text-heavy technical case studies."
