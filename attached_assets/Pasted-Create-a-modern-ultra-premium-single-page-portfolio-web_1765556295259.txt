Create a modern, ultra-premium single-page portfolio website for an automation agency called "CONSUL". The design should feel expensive, technical, and "rich" (similar to Speechify.com or linear.app).

**1. Design System & Aesthetics (The Vibe):**
*   **Theme:** Deepest Dark Mode. Background should be nearly black (#050505) with subtle noise texture.
*   **Typography:** Large, tracking-wide sans-serif headings (Inter or Geist). Headlines should have a subtle gradient (White to Light Gray) text fill.
*   **Components:** "Bento Grid" layout for projects. Cards should have a glassmorphism effect: slightly lighter black background, 1px subtle gray border, and backdrop blur.
*   **Accents:** Minimal white glowing effects. No bright primary colors (blue/green/red)—stick to monochrome white/gray/silver.
*   **Animations:** Elements should fade in upwards as the user scrolls.

**2. Section-by-Section Structure (Skeleton):**

**Section A: Hero (Viewport Height: 100vh)**
*   A pitch-black section.
*   Center text: "CONSUL" in massive, bold, wide-spaced letters (opacity 90%).
*   Subtext below: "Building the invisible infrastructure of success." (Small, gray, monospaced font).
*   Visual: A subtle, slow-moving abstract glow or mesh gradient behind the text.

**Section B: The "What We Do" Marquee**
*   A slim horizontal strip.
*   Infinite scrolling marquee of logos (placeholders are fine).
*   Logos should be monochrome (gray) and turn white on hover.
*   Headline above marquee: "Trusted to build on and around:"

**Section C: "Production-Grade Solutions" (The Bento Grid)**
*   Headline: "Deployed Systems".
*   Layout: A CSS Grid (Bento Box style).
*   **Card 1 (Large, spans 2 cols):** "EstateSync". Needs a placeholder for a video/image. Label: "Real Estate Automation".
*   **Card 2 (Tall, vertical):** "NinjaTrader Licensing". Label: "DRM Infrastructure".
*   **Card 3 (Standard):** "Operations Dashboard". Label: "Agency OS".
*   **Card 4 (Standard):** "RFQ Automation". Label: "FinTech Processing".
*   *Note:* All cards should look like premium software interfaces with a "View Demo" button that appears on hover.

**Section D: The Process (Timeline)**
*   Headline: "How We Work".
*   A vertical line down the center.
*   3 Steps alternating left and right:
    1. "Discovery" (Free Audit)
    2. "Solution Design" (Blueprint)
    3. "Build & Launch" (Execution)

**Section E: Contact / Footer**
*   Massive, screen-width button or container.
*   Text: "Your infrastructure is waiting."
*   Button: "Start Discovery".
*   Simple footer with links: LinkedIn, GitHub, Email.

**3. Technical Requirements:**
*   Use React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations.
*   Make it fully responsive (mobile stack, desktop grid).
*   Ensure the background remains fixed/consistent dark mode throughout.
