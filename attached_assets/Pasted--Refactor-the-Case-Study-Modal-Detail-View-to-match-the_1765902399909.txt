"Refactor the Case Study Modal (Detail View) to match the site's dark, premium aesthetic. Use the 'Checkpoint' text structure.

Design Requirements
1. Visual Style (Dark & Premium)

Background: Dark (var(--color-background) or #000000).

Text: White/Gray (var(--color-text-primary) for headings, var(--color-text-secondary) for body).

Width: Max 800px, centered. Focus on readability.

Typography:

Headers: Bold, clean sans-serif.

Checkpoint Labels: Monospace/Technical (e.g., CHECKPOINT // 01).

Body Text: Relaxed line-height, legible size (16px).

2. Layout Structure

Header:

Category Badge (Small, border, muted).

Main Title (Large, e.g., 'EstateSync Agent OS').

Subheadline (The 'Hook').

The 4 Checkpoints (Vertical Stack):

01 // HIDDEN CONSTRAINT (The Problem)

02 // DISCOVERY (The Insight)

03 // BLUEPRINT (The Architecture/Steps)

04 // RESULTS (The Metrics)

Footer: Sticky or static 'Book a Call' button (Accent color).

Content Data (The 4 Detailed + 2 Generated)
Update the caseStudies data to include this full text:

1. EstateSync Agent OS

Headline: Properties matched, clients reached, deals closed — without the manual work.

Constraint: Agents lost deals due to slow manual matching (2-4 hours/listing). Outreach was impersonal (8% response).

Discovery: The bottleneck wasn't complexity, it was speed. Agents needed real-time matching while keeping their personal voice.

Blueprint:

Property Matching Engine (Real-time listing vs. client prefs).

Personal Outreach Gen (AI emails in agent's voice).

Agent Dashboard (Actionable leads only).

Auto-Follow-up (Templated nurturing).

Results: 2-min matching (was 4 hours), 23% response rate, 38% close rate on matched leads.

2. Client Command Center

Headline: Onboarding, support, updates — all in one place.

Constraint: Onboarding was chaos across 5 platforms. 40% drop-off rate. Admins spent 3h/week chasing clients.

Discovery: Clients needed ONE place (Slack), ONE checklist, and ONE bot. Content wasn't the issue, delivery was.

Blueprint:

Private Client Channel (Slack).

Auto-Checklist (Visual progress).

Support Bot (Instant FAQs).

Admin Dashboard (Real-time status).

Results: 94% completion rate, 15-min support resolution (was 8h), 20 min/week admin time.

3. Enterprise Licensing

Headline: Zero manual overhead license management.

Constraint: 30% revenue leakage via sharing. Manual keys = errors. Revocation took 48h.

Discovery: Needed session-level verification and instant revocation, not just static keys.

Blueprint:

Auto-Gen Keys (On-demand).

Real-Time Session Verify (Launch check).

Fraud Detection (Anomaly flagging).

Instant Revocation (Payment fail = lockout).

Results: <5 min revocation, <3% leakage, Audit trail complete.

4. Approval Engine

Headline: No more bottlenecks.

Constraint: Decisions stuck in inboxes. 5 days for discount approval. 15% lost requests.

Discovery: Visibility was the problem. Needed parallel routing and real-time queues.

Blueprint:

Smart Intake Forms.

Parallel Routing (Finance + Legal same time).

Auto-Escalation (24h delays).

Audit Trail.

Results: 4-hour approvals (was 5 days), 0% lost requests.

5. Omnichannel Engine (Content)

Headline: 10x output, same team.

Constraint: Manual editing bottleneck. Team burned out posting 10x/week vs competitors' 100x.

Discovery: Repurposing logic is repetitive. AI can handle the formatting/cutting, humans handle the strategy.

Blueprint:

Ingestion (Drive/Dropbox).

AI Clip Gen (FFmpeg + GPT).

Caption Optimization (Platform specific).

Auto-Schedule.

Results: 100 posts/week, 92% time saved.

6. Predictive Supply Chain

Headline: Capital freed, stockouts zeroed.

Constraint: Manual forecasting led to overstock in A and stockout in B. Capital tied up.

Discovery: Historical data + velocity trends could predict stockouts 2 weeks out.

Blueprint:

ERP Data Sync.

Velocity Modeling (AI Forecast).

Rebalance Logic (Move A to B).

Auto-PO Gen.

Results: $1.2M capital freed, 0 stockouts in 6 months.

Implementation
Code the CaseStudyModal:

Use a dark theme (bg-black or similar).

Render the 4 Checkpoints with a vertical line connecting them (timeline look).

Use monospace font for the "CHECKPOINT 01" labels to give it that engineering feel.

Ensure text is legible (light gray on dark).

Update caseStudies array: Add the detailed text fields (checkpoints object) to all 6 items.

Connect Grid to Modal: Clicking a bento box opens this detailed view.

Aesthetic Reference: Think 'Terminal' meets 'High-End SaaS'. Clean, dark, text-focused."
